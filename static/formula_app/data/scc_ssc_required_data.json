    "comment": "Determine the maximum Brinnell hardness actually measured at the weldments of the steel components. Report readings actually taken as Brinnell, not converted from finer techniques (e.g. Vickers, Knoop, etc.). If actual readings are not available, use the maximum allowable hardness permitted by the fabrication specification."
