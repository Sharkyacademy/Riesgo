Cooling rates faster than those obtained in air, followed by tempering, as permitted by the material specification, are considered equivalent to normalizing and tempering heat treatments. b. Fine-grain practice is defined as the procedures necessary to obtain a fine austenitic grain size as described in SA-20.",
        "3. The first edition of the API Code for Unfired Pressure Vessels (discontinued in 1956) included these ASTM carbon steel plate specifications. These specifications were variously designated for structural steel for bridges, locomotives, and rail cars or for boilers and firebox steel for locomotives and stationary service. ASTM A149 and A150 were applicable to high-tensile-strength carbon steel plates for pressure vessels.",
        "4. The 1934 edition of Section VIII of the ASME Code listed a series of ASME steel specifications, including S1 and S2 for forge welding; S26 and S27 for carbon steel plates; and S25 for open-hearth iron. The titles of some of these specifications are similar to the ASTM specifications listed in the 1934 edition of the API Code for Unfired Pressure Vessels.",
        "5. These two steels were replaced in strength grades by the four grades specified in ASTM A515 and the four grades specified in ASTM A516. Steel in accordance with ASTM A212 was made only in strength grades the same as Grades 65 and 70 and has accounted for several known brittle failures. Steels in conformance with ASTM A201 and A212 should be assigned to Curve A unless it can be established that the steel was produced by fine-grain practice, which may have enhanced the toughness properties.",
        "6. No attempt has been made to make a list of obsolete specifications for tubes, pipes, forgings, bars, and castings. Unless specific information to the contrary is available, all of these product forms should be assigned to Curve A."
